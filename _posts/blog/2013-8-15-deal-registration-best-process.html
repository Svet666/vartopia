<p>We&#8217;ve spoken with hundreds of technology reseller partners about how they manage deal registration. The common struggle is between improving consistency and quality of registrations with reducing the administrative burden on sales people. We consistently see three models employed:</p>
<ul class="left">
<li><strong>Individual Sales People</strong> – Each sales person and/or their assigned inside sales person register their own deals.</li>
<li><strong>Centralized Team</strong> – A dedicated team of individuals register all deals for the company. These teams may include vendor-specific specialists as well as generalists.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid</strong> – It ranges from an orderly combination of the above to the wild west.</li>
<p>Here is a summary of the pros and cons of <strong>individual sales people</strong> registering their own deals:</p>

<table id="style1">
		<thead>
			<tr><th scope="col" class="t3" id="n1">Pros</th><th scope="col" class="t3" id="n2">Cons</th></tr></thead>
	<tbody><tr class="table-alternate row1"> <td id="n1" class="start">•	Registrations submitted faster because one less step.</td><td id="n2" >•	Multiple sets of credentials required for each sales person</td></tr><tr class= "table-noalt row2"><td id="n1" class="start">•	Potential for higher approval rates due to more complete, higher quality of information submitted.</td><td id="n2" >•	More administrative work for sales people </td></tr><tr class="table-alternate row3"> <td id="n1" class="start">•	Registration with appropriate vendors, and often times more vendors</td><td id="n2" >•	Will register prime vendor, but may wait for approval before registering with other vendors.  May forget to register the opportunity with any vendor.</td></tr><tr class= "table-noalt row4"><td id="n1" class="start">•	Sales reps maintain a greater sense of ownership of the process</td><td id="n2" >•	Company vulnerable if sales person leaves, and company can't quickly access registration information</td></tr><tr class="table-alternate row5"> <td id="n1" class="start"></td><td id="n2" >•	If VAR tracks registration data in CRM, sales people often don’t update it enough for accurate reporting</td></tr><tr class= "table-noalt row6"><td id="n1" class="start"></td><td id="n2" >•	Hard to track registrations stuck in vendor approval process and expiring registrations</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>On the flip side, here’s a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of a <strong>centralized approach</strong>:</p>

<table id="style1">
		<thead>
			<tr><th scope="col" class="t2" id="n1">Pros</th><th scope="col" class="t2" id="n2">Cons</th></tr></thead>
	<tbody><tr class="table-alternate row1"> <td id="n1" class="start">•	Sales people spend less time on administrative work even with back and forth emails and phone calls</td><td id="n2" >•	Registration submission times increase due to the multistep process</td></tr><tr class= "table-noalt row2"><td id="n1" class="start">•	Easier to enforce sales processes</td><td id="n2" >•	Sales people engage less, assume less responsibility</td></tr><tr class="table-alternate row3"> <td id="n1" class="start">•	More registration data will be manually entered into CRM </td><td id="n2" >•	Approval rates may decrease because the quality of the registration data submitted decreases</td></tr><tr class= "table-noalt row4"><td id="n1" class="start">•	Easier credential management and security management</td><td id="n2" >•	Veteran sales reps who liked to maintain deal control, may not trust the process, and delay or avoid registering certain deals </td></tr><tr class="table-alternate row5"> <td id="n1" class="start"></td><td id="n2" >•	If registration information is manually tracked in CRM, sales people often don’t update it enough for accurate reporting</td></tr><tr class= "table-noalt row6"><td id="n1" class="start"></td><td id="n2" >•	Hard to track registrations stuck in Vendor approval process and expiring registrations</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The <strong>Hybrid approach</strong> looks more like a free-for-all.  Sales engineers may be involved in the registration process.  All registration activity may be at the rep level, while for a specific vendor, the vendor manager may do it.</p>
<p>The truth is that any of these processes can work.  However, we believe that centralized visibility for all stakeholders in the organization determines whether registration profits rise or fall.  Without an easy to access and consume centralized <span style="text-decoration: underline;">view</span> of deal registration, it’s difficult to:</p>
<ul class="left">
<li>Ensure that all eligible opportunities are registered with all applicable vendors</li>
<li>See which registrations are still stuck in the vendor approval process</li>
<li>See what registrations will expire today, this week, this month etc.</li>
<li>Effectively share registration information with all stakeholders in your organization</li>
<li>Understand which registrations are at risk when a sales person leaves a VAR organization</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, people can only manage what they see.  In our next blog we will profile a few of our customers, and give a detailed overview of how improved visibility impacts their deal registration program participation.</p>
