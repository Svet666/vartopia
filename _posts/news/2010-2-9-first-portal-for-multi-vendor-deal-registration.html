<p><em><strong>New Web Service Streamlines Deal Registration Submissions, Provides Increased Visibility for Profit Margin Management, and Increases Access and Awareness of Deal Registration Programs</strong><br />
</em><br />
Jackson, Wyoming &#8212; Vartopia, LLC, today announced the official release of the IT Channel’s first portal for multi-vendor deal registration at VMware’s Partner Exchange Event.  Vartopia has integrated with the existing registration systems of Cisco, Dell, EMC, HP, VMware and other leading vendors to help VARs lower costs and improve profit margin management associated with registration programs.  Key highlights of Vartopia’s evolutionary, non-disruptive Deal Registration 2.0 platform:</p>
<ul class="left">
<li>Vartopia Deal Registration Vendor Information – a centralized repository of deal registration program information and a gateway to vendor partner portal systems to increase deal registration program access and awareness.</li>
<li>Vartopia Registration Submission Engine – a streamlined deal registration submission tool that eliminates work for users, and prompts users to sell vendor- and VAR-created solution bundles.  </li>
<li>Vartopia Registration Viewer – a centralized view of all deal registration activity across the company by sales rep, customer and vendor.</li>
</ul>
<p>“As a top partner for VMware, EqualLogic and Riverbed, 40% of our gross profit came from deal registration.  Yet it was a constant struggle to ensure that all opportunities were registered,” said Mike Reilly, former CEO of Foedus, and current CEO of Vartopia.  “We want to unlock the potential of deal registration programs by removing administrative obstacles and improving management visibility.   We want to help VARs and vendors drive consistent solution-selling behavior.  We think we succeeded.” </p>
<p>Vartopia’s solution is available on a monthly per user subscription license basis.  For more information on the Vartopia solution, please visit www.vartopia.com. </p>

 “We understand the burden of navigating to multiple vendor portals and performing repetitive data entry.  As a result, we frequently see only the largest deals being registered by some VARs.  Unfortunately, this leaves well-earned profit margin on the table for the VAR, and deprives us of the sales pipeline visibility that we could use to help our channel partners increase the size of a deal or simply close the deal.  We think Vartopia’s solution take a huge step towards solving this problem.”<br />
- Andrew Stewart, Vice President WW Channel and Sales Operations, Force 10</p>
<p>“Vartopia will help our Partners take full advantage of Vizioncore’s Deal Registration Program.  In addition to reducing operational overhead for our partners, we believe that Vartopia’s Solution Bundles will allow them to increase Vizioncore attach rates &#8211; completing the solution for their virtualization opportunities.<br />
- Joe Castro,  VP of Sales North America, Vizioncore</p>
<p>“Deal registration is a strategic, goal-aligning force for VMware and our partners. We are always looking for ways to enhance the effectiveness our deal registration programs and to make it as easy as possible for our partners to do business with us.  As a result, VMware is pleased to support Vartopia’s efforts to reduce the data entry burden of deal registration, provide VAR management better visibility to drive desired sales behavior and help close more deals.”<br />
- Doug Smith, Senior Director, Global Partner Sales, VMware</p>
<p>&#8220;Since Wyse&#8217;s business is sold through our channel partners, it is very important to us to provide them with as many helpful sales tools as possible and Vartopia&#8217;s new deal registration portal is an excellent example of this.  We look forward to the enhancement and better visibility of deal registration and feel this is a &#8220;win-win&#8221; solution.  Wyse fully supports Vartopia.&#8221;<br />

“Registration is critical to our profitability and we saw immediate benefit with Vartopia.  The first day we used their application, we uncovered new registration opportunities worth more than $35,000 in gross profit. Vartopia is bringing a valuable and much-needed solution to the Channel.”<br />
- David Cote, VP of Sales, GreenPages Technology Solutions</p>
<p>“Due to the critical nature of deal registration to our business, we had  centralized the process.   Vartopia allowed us to give the responsibility back to the our sales reps without losing our visibility.  Our reps actually want to use Vartopia because it helps them take advantage of all the programs, saving their customers money and maximizing their commissions.”<br />
- Peter Estes, President and CEO of Axis Business Systems</p>
<p>“Based on our experience so far, Vartopia is going to be a game changer for the Channel.”<br />
- Adam Bari, Managing Director at IPM</p>
<p>“Vartopia’s application  crosses the chasm between selling products and enabling integrated solutions from multiple vendors. The complexity of registering an opportunity within each vendor’s program and monitoring performance and payment has been an administrative burden.   Vartopia will allow us to manage the process in a professional, effective manner and keep our Sales Reps focused on selling activities.”<br />
-Harry Zarek, President of Compugen Inc., Canada’s largest privately owned technology solution provider. </p>
<p>As a premier datacenter technology and solutions provider, we needed a solution that could manage, report and maintain all of our vendors in one central repository. Vartopia has developed a groundbreaking solution that does just that. We now have the ability to report on all registered deals across the many vendors we do business with and be able to build solutions in the portal that match our sales and marketing campaigns. Rolling up all that data prior to Vartopia was virtually impossible. The ROI is immediate and it will no doubt be a tool that will be integral to our company.<br />
