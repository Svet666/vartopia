<p>We’re pleased to announce exciting changes to our integration with VMware’s deal registration system. Vartopia users can now register deals with any VMware deal registration program including Advantage+, Gov+, ELA and the new EPP and Opportunity Identification programs.</p>
<p>VMware also worked closely with Vartopia to provide the ability to make updates to existing registrations from within Vartopia. This time-saving enhancement allows users to stay within Vartopia to manage the full life-cycle of their VMware registrations. This includes requesting extensions for registrations before they expire and responding to VMware inquiries.</p>
