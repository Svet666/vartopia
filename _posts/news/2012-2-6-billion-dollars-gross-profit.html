<h3>What’s it like to talk to a solution provider about deal registration? </h3> 
<p>It goes something like this:</p>
<p>We’ll ask, “How important is deal registration to your gross margins?”</p>
<p>“It’s probably the #1 driver of deal profitability.”</p>
<p>“What percentage of your Vendor revenue is registered now?</p>
<p>“I honestly don’t know…”</p>
<p>“I bet we’re missing 10%?  Maybe as much as 15-20%.  We do a pretty good job with our larger vendor partners, and the largest deals, but the rest?  Hard to say.”</p>
<p>“We’ve heard estimates as high as 35% to 50%. Conversations with vendors suggest that if every eligible deal were registered, partners would put an extra $1 Billion in their pockets.”</p>
<p>“Look, I know we are leaving money on the table, not registering all our deals, missing out on margin and or revenue due to expired registrations etc.  Registration is great in concept but painful in practice”</p>
<p>“Exactly.  That’s what we felt when we were running our last company.   Here’s the problem: every vendor has their own system. Too many systems to deal with means sales teams are going to let things fall through the cracks, and management can’t monitor and manage the situation.   Our solution: a platform that integrates with the different vendor systems to create a single location for deal registration that you can integrate directly into your CRM.</p>
<p>“Excuse me while I pick my jaw up off the floor.”</p>
<p>We’ve had this conversation again and again in the past few years. When we started Vartopia, we saw that if we integrated with the vendor systems, we could:</p>
<ul class="left">
<li>Ensure your opportunities are registered</li>
<li>Add profits by prompting the sales person to register complimentary vendors</li>
<li>Compare registration performance trends by sales team or vendor</li>
<li>Save a lot of time navigating, clicking, and entering data</li>
<li>Increase registration rates for better collaboration and forecasting</li>
<li>Make participants feel smarter than their competitors</li>
<li>Have a positive impact on the channel</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we figured out how hard a problem it was to solve, we couldn’t not do it.</p>
<p>So we created Vartopia, and started recruiting vendors to participate in the Vartopia Network. It’s certainly been challenging and it has taken longer than anyone wanted, but we kinda knew this when we started. Not every channel team moves at the same speed, and not every IT department has an open slot on their schedule to engage with us. Fortunately, we’ve had great support and encouragement from an incredible group of vendors and partners, and we thank them.</p>
<p>On behalf of the entire Vartopia team, it’s exciting to finally be able to deliver on our vision.</p>
