<h2 class="posts_title">The Easiest Place to Register NetApp Deals?</h2>
<p>Big news.  You can now register any NetApp deal, including Flexpod opportunities, in Vartopia, either through our Portal or from your CRM.</p>
<p>Thanks to some great teams and individuals at NetApp, we have integrated Vartopia with their deal registration system.  When you login to Vartopia MVS Web or MVS CRM, you can submit registrations directly to NetApp.  But it gets even better.</p>
<p>When you register a Flexpod deal through Vartopia, we’ll also register it with the Flexpod sales desk, the NetApp deal registration system, Cisco, and VMware.  You register it once, and we’ll pass it to all three Flexpod stakeholders.</p>
<p>What’s required to get started?  Not much.  Solution providers who are already on the Vartopia platform will simply need to provide their NetApp partner credentials.  Within minutes, you will be able to start registering.</p>
<p>If you are a NetApp partner and are not on the Vartopia platform, give us a call.  We would love to help you register more of your opportunities and remove some of the no-fun work required to deliver higher gross profits.</p>
