<h2>100 Resellers Connect to 10 Top Vendors and Process Over $26 Billion of Opportunities</h2>

<p>Jackson, Wyoming– December 12, 2013 – Vartopia, a leading provider of solutions to the information technology channel, today announced its new 4.0 platform powering the company’s Deal Registration Network. Currently over 100 technology resellers leverage the Network to increase profitability by maximizing their deal registration participation within top IT vendor’s programs. To date, Vartopia’s Network has processed over 175,000 deal registrations worth more than $26.5 Billion in total opportunity value. </p> 

<p>The Deal Registration Network greatly reduces the operational complexity when resellers register their associated deals with IT vendors. The Network offers a single interface used to submit, manage and measure deal registrations for all IT vendors connected to the Network.</p> 

<blockquote>“Most reseller executives aren’t aware of how much gross profit is being left on the table,” said Michael Reilly, CEO, Vartopia. “They typically have a misperception that their sales organization is registering all appropriate opportunities to take full advantage of deal registration programs —when the reality is quite different due to the inherent complexities associated with the process. Vartopia’s Deal Registration Network addresses this issue by simplifying the entire process into one consolidated platform with full tracking and reporting abilities.” </blockquote>

<p>In addition, Vartopia also addresses these complexities by offering several different user interface options that make it easy to access the Network. Options available include a powerful web-based application or separate modules that integrate directly into common CRM systems used by resellers today. </p>

 The enhanced Deal Registration Network provides the following features and benefits:
<ul>
  <li>A safe and secure system for managing deal registrations with manufacturers.</li>
  <li> A registration submission engine that allows opportunities to be submitted to multiple IT vendors simultaneously, reducing the amount of data entry by as much as 60 percent.</li>
  <li>Powerful reporting and analytics tools.</li>
  <li>Increased profitability.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>“We were already headed toward a deal registration best practice, and Vartopia came along,” said John Cook, Director RFP Response Team at Core BTS, Inc. “Vartopia has really allowed us to accelerate our deal registration process and execute much faster. We’re able to do more registrations; close more deals and make more margin. We’ve got deal registration religion. Now, reps can hardly wait to submit deal registrations. Our process and Vartopia technology have allowed us to drive proper behavior and increase monthly deal registrations by more than 20 percent.”</blockquote>

<p>In addition to helping resellers, IT vendors are also receiving significant value from participating in Vartopia’s Network, driven by increased participation in their programs.</p>

Vartopia has developed a comprehensive set of tools and products that allow IT vendors to leverage the Network and receive:
<ul>
<li>Increased participation in their deal registration programs.</li>
<li>Improved data quality.</li>
<li>Earlier notification of potential opportunities.</li>
<li>Enhanced sales collaboration.</li>
<li>Higher partner profitability.</li>
<li>Improved operational efficiencies. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>“Vartopia provides us the ability to manage vendor programs more efficiently and given a choice, we would prefer to work with vendors in the Vartopia Network—they’ll get our business,” said Harry Zarek, President & CEO, Compugen.</blockquote>
